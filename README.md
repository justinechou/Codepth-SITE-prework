The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
N/A

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
I had trouble figuring out the algorithm of when to show the pop up message of when the user wins or when the user loses the game. While I was confused at first, I took the diagram as a guide to understand how 
to implement it. On paper, I mapped out the different if-else statements, and looked up how to implement them in JavaScript. Since I havent worked with JavaScript before, instead mainly using Python and Java, I 
had to find the best way to translate it. Through trial and error and mutiple testings, I was able to get the correct algorithm that allowed my code to work properly. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I would like to know more about adding other visuals such as images, animations, and videos within my projects. I would also like to know how to add different pages such as when developing a website. 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I had more time to work on the project, I would have implemented more additional features, such as more buttons, playing randomly generated patterns, and having a time limit for the user to enter their turn.
